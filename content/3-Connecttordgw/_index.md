#### Connect to RDGW

The next step is to log in to the **Remote Desktop Gateway (RDGW)** server using the **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**. If you are using a **Windows** computer, RDP is already available. If you are using a Mac, you need to download the RDP application [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-mac).

1. Log in to **AWS Console** and access **EC2 Management Console**.
