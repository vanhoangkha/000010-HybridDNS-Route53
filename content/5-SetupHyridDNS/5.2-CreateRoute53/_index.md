#### Create Route 53 Resolver Rules

The next step is to create **Route 53 Resolver** Rules. **Route 53 Resolver** rule allows you to define two actions: Forward or System.

- With Forward, you can configure **Route 53 Resolver** to forward **DNS** queries to an external **DNS** resolver (e.g., your on-premise **DNS** server).
- With System, Route 53 will query internally to resolve domain names (Private **DNS** zones, VPC **DNS**, and Public **DNS**).

1. Access **Route 53 console** through the search box and search for **Route 53**.
   - In the left sidebar, select **Rules** and select **Create rule**.

2. Enter the following information:
   - **Name**: `FowardToOnPremAD`
   - **Rule type**: Forward
   - **Domain name**: `onprem.example.com.` (This is the domain name of the directory you created in the previous section)
   - **VPC that use this rule**: HybridDNS-VPCStack
   - **Outbound Endpoint**: R53-OutboundEndpoint

3. In Target IP addresses, enter the two IP addresses of **AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory** that were recorded. Note, you need to select Add target to add the second IP address.

   - Select **Submit**

4. Complete creating Route 53 Resolver

5. At this point, you have configured **Route 53 Resolver** to forward queries for onprem.example.com to another **DNS** resolver (e.g., AWS Managed Microsoft AD). The domain name, onprem.example.com, simulates a **DNS** domain hosted by your on-premise **DNS** system.
