#### Deploy Microsoft AD

To simulate on-premise **DNS**, we will use the **AWS Directory Service** to deploy **AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory** in the two private subnets created by CloudFormation as shown below:

1. Log in to **AWS Console** and access Directory Service console through the search box and search for Directory Services.

   - Make sure you have selected the correct **Region**. Pay attention to the upper left corner of the **AWS Console** and select the correct Region you need (Here we are selecting us-east-2)

2. If this is your first time accessing **Directory Services** in this region, you will be taken to the initial welcome screen. Expand the left sidebar and select **Directories**.

   - Select **Set up directory**.

3. Select **Directory types**, choose **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**.

4. On the **Enter Directory Information** page, enter the following information:

   - In **Edition**: select **Standard Edition**.

   - In **Directory DNS name**: `onprem.example.com` (this **DNS** name must be unique among your directories).

   - In **Directory NetBIOS name**: `onprem` (this **NetBIOS** name must be unique among your directories).

5. Continue configuration:

   - In **Directory Description**: `This is to simulate the on-prem AD`.

   - In **Admin Password**: Use a password you can remember. Please note the password complexity requirements listed on the screen.

   - In **Confirm password**: Enter the password again.

   - Select **Next**.

6. In **Choose VPC and subnets**, select **VPC Hybrid-DNS-VPCStack** that we created earlier and the two private subnets **Private subnet 1A** and **Private subnet 2A**. Then, select **Next**.

7. On the **Review & create** screen, review the settings and select **Create Directory**.

8. The directory will take about 20 minutes to create. During this time, AWS will provision two **Windows** servers and promote them to **Active Directory** domain controllers for the AD forest you specified. This AD forest will be a new AD forest. The process will complete when you see the status change to Active.

9. When the directory has been created, you can view details by clicking on the **Directory ID**. The two **DNS** IP addresses listed are the IP addresses of **elastic network interfaces** (ENI) that have been placed in your availability zone to communicate with **AWS Managed Microsoft AD Domain Controllers**.
